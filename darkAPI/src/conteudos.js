If you lock on and cast some pyromancy spells you can hit them all with the splash damage. The corners at the end of the room work best when attempting this maneuver. If necessary move back and forth along the ledge to re-aggro and get them into another group. You must be close to the edge while casting, being careful not to fall to a quick and certain death at the hands of the giant skeletons.",

The pendant proceeds to sit in your inventory till the end of the game as there's absolutely nothing you can do with that thing.

Reah does not have it on her when she's found praying in front of a statue in Undead Parish. The same statue is found near the Darkmoon Ring and the Sunlight Altar. You can trade it in to Snuggly for a Souvenir of Reprisal. Souvenirs of Reprisal are offerings in the Darkmoon covenant. The description of the pendant matches that of the sunlight medal (could be just a translation error). Please let me know if there are any other connections or clues about the pendant and I'll add it to the list. The only trail I seem to be finding is that it's pointing me in the direction of Gwyn's offsprings or towards \"protectors\" (Darkmoons and Forest Hunters). Someone pointed out that the pendant also looks dirty or covered in mud. I tried thinking of a way to \"wash it off\" and thought about dropping it in the Ash Lake. It didn't change anything about it so I decided to quit and reload ala snuggly trade. All that did was make the item disappear. So now I'm stuck with the pendant Reah dropped. I'll try and see if I can do anything special with it in Gwyn's tomb or Gwynevere's chamber."
